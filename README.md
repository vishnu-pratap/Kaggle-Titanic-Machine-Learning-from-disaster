# Kaggle-Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-disaster
This is a kaggle problem where I use Machine learning to identify groups of people who are likely to survive the disaster.
I have used a binary classification technique using decision trees in order to predict if a passenger would survive or not.
Output variable is Survived:  1 for survived, 0 for deceased
